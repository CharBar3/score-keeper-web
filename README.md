# Score Keeper (name tbd - work in progress)

#### The problem
Often during board game nights with my girlfriend it falls on me to keep track of the score. While I love losing my focus on the game to do basic math and keep track of each players score after a move is made, I figured I could make that process more seamless.

#### The solution

A score tracking app! Score keeper is designed so everyone can keep track of their own score while still leaving the option for one person to update them all. 

## Main Features

1. Real time updates while you're viewing the game. You can see exactly where you stack up against all competing players and even make sure some less savory players don’t add a few extra points to their score. 

2. Guest players. Sometimes your friends don’t want to make a new account. No problem! You can still do things the old way and keep track of their score for them. 

3. Partial username search! You don't have to know your friends full username. Just start typing it in and the search function will take care of the rest.  

4. Randomly generated colors. Every time you make a game the color for the game and the color for each player will be randomly generated! This keeps everything fresh and exciting. That being said, if you’re someone who likes consistency, you can still pick your preferred color.

## Future Features (What I'm currently working on because this is still in development)

* A friend can currently be added without being accepted by the friend. Friend request feature where the request has to be accepted. 
* Selectable icons for your game. Right now it's one single icon but eventually you'll be able to select from a list. 
* Color selector. Currently you can edit your RGB values but I want to add standard colors you can select.
